光谱仪更新历史：

V1：2023年12月3日，根据Eol'Ex结构进行改进，基于单双凸透镜设计的光管、外壳，因此尺寸更加紧凑。V1中的准直镜为单双凸透镜，透过波段为350-700nm，外径25.4mm，焦距75mm，镜片边缘厚度2mm。V1中的成像物镜为单双凸透镜，透过波段为350-700nm，外径25.4mm，焦距125mm，镜片边缘厚度2mm。（V1光管可以适应边缘厚度为2-3mm的透镜）；

V2：2023年12月21日，基于双胶合透镜设计的光管、外壳，因此尺寸相比V1稍大些。V1中的准直镜为双胶合双凸透镜，外径25.4mm，焦距80mm，镜片边缘厚度为5mm的双胶合镜片。V1中的成像物镜为单双凸透镜，外径25.4mm，焦距125mm，镜片边缘厚度为5mm的双胶合镜片。（V2光管可以适应边缘厚度为5-8mm的透镜）；V1、V2与Sol’Ex原版的区别：1.取消外置光管；2.增加狭缝微调拨杆；3.上盖增加了遮光挡条；4.外壳底部增加相机1/4螺纹口；5.3D打印的螺旋调焦座；

V4.3：2024年11月04日，增加盖板开窗，增加潜望式校准棱镜，增加开窗堵盖，在不拆改盖板的前提下，插入校准棱镜，即可对成像物镜进行校准。

配件更新历史：

指向器：2024年03月17日，与原版基本一致，唯一的不同是对相机成像镜头的光管进行了修改，以中国大陆能够采购的微小镜片尺寸而设计。具体参数见指向器文件夹内txt文档。

螺旋调焦座：2024年05月13日，为了降低成本、减轻整机重量，设计了一款3D打印的螺旋调焦座，可替换全金属双螺旋调焦座。

----------
使用方法：

1.相机和狭缝校准：相机放入成像镜调焦座，对准任意天空，根据画面进行旋转相机和微调狭缝，让谱线在相机画面中横平竖直；

2.成像透镜校准：插入成像镜校准棱镜，在校准棱镜上额外增加一个1.25天顶镜，1.25天顶镜前端增加一片UV/IR cut，然后对准窗外较远处任意目标进行校准，并锁紧调焦座；

3.准直透镜校准：将光谱仪接入望远镜调焦座，光栅拨盘旋转至要观测的谱线并画面居中，微调准直镜拨盘进行准直透镜的校准，谱线清晰时上下两侧会出现锯齿；

4.望远镜与狭缝校准：微调望远镜调焦旋钮，直至垂直于谱线众多小细线最多、最密；此特征为日面米粒、活动特征产生的细小竖线，出现时也代表日面特征合焦；

5.此时，可以对太阳进行扫描拍摄。

English explanation:

At the forefront: Based on the principle of Eol'Ex spectrometer, structural modifications have been made to improve the overall strength of the casing.

Spectrometer update history:

V1: On December 3, 2023, based on the Eol'Ex structure, improvements were made to the light pipe and housing designed with a single double convex lens, resulting in a more compact size. The collimating lens in V1 is a single double convex lens with a transmission wavelength range of 350-700nm, an outer diameter of 25.4mm, a focal length of 75mm, and a lens edge thickness of 2mm. The imaging objective in V1 is a single double convex lens with a transmission wavelength range of 350-700nm, an outer diameter of 25.4mm, a focal length of 125mm, and a lens edge thickness of 2mm. (V1 light pipe can adapt to lenses with edge thickness of 2-3mm);

V2: On December 21, 2023, the light pipe and housing were designed based on double laminated lenses, resulting in slightly larger dimensions compared to V1. The collimating lens in V1 is a double laminated double convex lens with an outer diameter of 25.4mm, a focal length of 80mm, and a double laminated lens edge thickness of 5mm. The imaging objective in V1 is a single double convex lens with an outer diameter of 25.4mm, a focal length of 125mm, and a double laminated lens edge thickness of 5mm. (V2 light tube can adapt to lenses with edge thickness of 5-8mm); The difference between V1, V2 and Sol'Ex original version: 1. Cancel the external light pipe; 2. Add a slit fine adjustment lever; 3. The upper cover has added a light blocking strip; 4. Add a 1/4 threaded hole for the camera at the bottom of the casing; Spiral focusing seat for 5.3D printing;

V4.3: On November 4, 2024, an additional cover window was added, a periscope calibration prism was added, and a window cover was added. Without removing or modifying the cover plate, the calibration prism can be inserted to calibrate the imaging objective lens.

----------
Accessory update history:

Pointer: On March 17, 2024, it is basically the same as the original version. The only difference is that the light tube of the camera imaging lens has been modified, and it is designed according to the size of micro lenses that can be purchased in Chinese Mainland. Please refer to the txt document in the pointer folder for specific parameters.

Spiral focusing seat: On May 13, 2024, in order to reduce costs and overall weight, a 3D printed spiral focusing seat was designed, which can replace the all metal double spiral focusing seat.

----------
usage method:

1. Camera and slit calibration: Place the camera in the focusing seat of the imaging mirror, align it with any sky, rotate the camera and fine tune the slit according to the image, so that the spectral lines are horizontal and vertical in the camera image;

2. Imaging lens calibration: Insert the imaging mirror calibration prism, add an additional 1.25 zenith mirror on the calibration prism, add a UV/IR cut at the front end of the 1.25 zenith mirror, then align with any target farther outside the window for calibration, and lock the focusing seat;

3. Calibration of collimating lens: Connect the spectrometer to the focusing seat of the telescope, rotate the grating dial to the spectral line to be observed and center the image, fine tune the collimating lens dial for calibration of the collimating lens, and saw teeth will appear on both sides when the spectral line is clear;

4. Telescope and slit calibration: Fine tune the focusing knob of the telescope until there are the most numerous and dense small lines perpendicular to the spectral line; This feature is a small vertical line generated by the movement of rice grains on the solar surface, which also represents the focus of solar surface features when it appears;

5.At this point, the sun can be scanned and photographed.
