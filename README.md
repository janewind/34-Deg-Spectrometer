中文说明：

写在最前端：基于Eol’Ex光谱仪原理，进行了结构修改，以提高外壳整体强度较高。

V1、V2与Sol’Ex原版的区别：1.取消外置光管；2.增加狭缝微调拨杆；3.上盖增加了遮光挡条；4.外壳底部增加相机1/4螺纹口；5.3D打印的螺旋调焦座。

V1：基于单双凸透镜设计的光管、外壳，因此尺寸更加紧凑。V1中的准直镜为单双凸透镜，透过波段为350-700nm，外径25.4mm，焦距75mm，镜片边缘厚度2mm。V1中的成像物镜为单双凸透镜，透过波段为350-700nm，外径25.4mm，焦距125mm，镜片边缘厚度2mm。（V1光管可以适应边缘厚度为2-3mm的透镜）

V2：基于双胶合透镜设计的光管、外壳，因此尺寸相比V1稍大些。V1中的准直镜为双胶合双凸透镜，外径25.4mm，焦距80mm，镜片边缘厚度为5mm的双胶合镜片。V1中的成像物镜为单双凸透镜，外径25.4mm，焦距125mm，镜片边缘厚度为5mm的双胶合镜片。（V2光管可以适应边缘厚度为5-8mm的透镜）

指向器：与原版基本一致，唯一的不同是对相机成像镜头的光管进行了修改，以中国大陆能够采购的微小镜片尺寸而设计。具体参数见指向器文件夹内txt文档。

螺旋调焦座：为了降低成本、减轻整机重量，设计了一款3D打印的螺旋调焦座，可替换全金属双螺旋调焦座。

English explanation：

Written at the front: Based on the principle of the Eol’Ex spectrometer, the structure has been modified to improve the overall strength of the shell.

The differences between V1, V2 and the original version of Sol'Ex: 1. Cancel the external light pipe; 2. Add a slit fine-tuning lever; 3. Add a light-shielding strip to the upper cover; 4. Add a 1/4 threaded port for the camera at the bottom of the casing; 5.3D printed spiral focusing seat.

V1: Light pipe and housing based on single and double convex lens design, so the size is more compact. The collimating lens in V1 is a single and double convex lens, with a transmission band of 350-700nm, an outer diameter of 25.4mm, a focal length of 75mm, and a lens edge thickness of 2mm. The imaging objective lens in V1 is a single and double convex lens, with a transmission band of 350-700nm, an outer diameter of 25.4mm, a focal length of 125mm, and a lens edge thickness of 2mm. (V1 light pipe can adapt to lenses with edge thickness of 2-3mm)

V2: Based on the light pipe and housing designed by double cemented lenses, the size is slightly larger than V1. The collimating lens in V1 is a double cemented lenticular lens with an outer diameter of 25.4mm, a focal length of 80mm, and a lens edge thickness of 5mm. The imaging objective lens in V1 is a single double convex lens with an outer diameter of 25.4mm, a focal length of 125mm, and a double cemented lens with a lens edge thickness of 5mm. (V2 light pipe can adapt to lenses with edge thickness of 5-8mm)

Pointer: Basically the same as the original version, the only difference is that the light pipe of the camera imaging lens has been modified and designed with a tiny lens size that can be purchased in mainland China. For specific parameters, see the txt document in the pointer folder.

Spiral focusing base: In order to reduce the cost and weight of the entire machine, a 3D printed spiral focusing base is designed, which can replace the all-metal double spiral focusing base.
